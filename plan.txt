//TODO:
add real lighting
    status: read all of Carmack's .plan files
come up with a level format
    status: began implementing octree-based geometry indexing, slow going
decide on a proper string format
    status: added ICU to the project, but haven't really moved over to it yet
generalize key input for later rebinding
    status: not started
alt-tab support
    status: investigated and found nothing, ALT-TAB keystrokes are being
            eaten while I have mouse focus
collision
    status: rudimentary and bad collision is in, but it's buggy and doesn't use
            octrees
    gravity: ray cast down to see if the player is supported, move the player
             to that level of support
